      "When I was younger, I never quite understood people who didn’t like to travel. Why stay home when you could be elsewhere? Of course now, I get that there are a lot of different impediments that come with every trip: long plane rides, communicating in foreign languages, annoying people. But if you can get past all that, it’s worth it. Travel is finding beauty in places that are not always luxurious. It is finding a home in communities that are not home. It is tasting foods that feel different in our mouths and hearing mouths speak words that sound different to our ears. Last summer, my mom and I embarked on a trip to Dar es Salaam for two weeks. When I brought this up in conversation, it went something like this: “Dar es Salaam? Outside, I heard the shouting of vendors, trying to find amusement in the irony of selling pajamas at 3 am. “American” was a big name in a city like Dar, but it felt loose on me, drowning me with its baggy sleeves and modernity when I really just wanted to fit into what was smaller but too unfamiliar and torn to be comfortable. Pulling out my earbuds, I flip through my playlist for a song I can fall asleep to, eventually settling on “27” by Fall Out Boy. If home is where the heart is. Dawn arrived after I had barely gotten a couple hours of sleep. Bits of last night’s dinner conversation had revealed that we were going to the beach today, and I was dreading it. I hated swimming, and who knew what kind of bugs could be found on African beaches? I wore jeans and a long sleeve shirt, leaving the bathing suit my mom packed at their apartment. The ride there was hot and rocky. As drove, the grey worn asphalt turned to dirt and rocks. Every so often a ditch would appear, sending my and Zohra’s heads crashing into the roof of the backseat. At one point we passed a couple of kids, no more than seven years old, working on the road with shovels twice their height. “Look,” my mother said, as if to mean Aren’t you grateful for what you show more content",

      "The art of photographs has been progressing through decades. Photographers take pictures of anything that intrigues them, such as taking photos of nature, conflicts, violence, entertainment, or people. “Adding Emotion and Feeling to Photographs” by Peter West Carey introduces how photograph create emotions and how the photographers have to find the mood first before they take the photo. According to “The War Photo No One Would Publish” by Torie Rose DeGhett says, “The image and its anonymous subject might have come to symbolize the Gulf War” (DeGhett 74). A photographer, Kenneth Jarecke, took photos of a charred Iraqi, which show what the true reality of warfare. Photograph gives viewers that were not there during the event a taste of it. Instagram has widened the lane for photography. Instagram has allows people see and show others people art. Photos in instagram give emotions. According to “The Psychology of Selfies: Why We Love Taking and Viewing Photos of Faces” by Courtney Seiter,“Looking directly into the camera can help make a direct connection with someone. Looking to the left or right will help guide the reader’s eyes in that direction” (“Why We Love”). When one takes a selfie (a photo that is a self portrait) and he or she post it, the viewer look at the that photo and feel some type way. Like that person will think that person is beautiful. Social media allows people to tell stories of their everyday lives by posting what doing during the day. Such as posting going to park, taking picture of the meal they having for brunch, or taking a picture themselves trying on there new clothes. According to “We Are a Camera”, by Nick Paumgarten, “The Result is not as much a selfie as a wordie. It’s more like the story you’d tell about an adventure than the photo that would accompany” (Paumgarten 334). Social media allows people express other people art. When a person looks at a photo of girl on looking way from the camera. You wonder what is the girl is looking at. Thinking she is looking at someone else, look at squirrel, or staring out of. Everyone has different emotion or perspective while looking at a photo. Say there is photo of a boy outside in the rain. One viewer will feel that the photo is depressing. The other viewer will feel that the boy is having fun. It does not matter what type of photo is shown, it could show violence, an event, or a random person. ",

    title: "5 Shocking Facts About Pets",
    category: "Lifestyle",
    description:
      "Pets are a significant origin of love and friendship for many people. It is also a widely known fact that pets are outstanding for our well-being. Studies show that the relationships between humans and pets are very unique and it dates way far back into history. Throughout the past, pets have been part of the human culture for an extended time. Specifically, dogs have developed to become profoundly adapted to humans and their conduct and feelings more than any other animal. Overall, pets are recognized to influence an individual’s health in a beneficial way. According to a Veterinary Medical Association, “The human-animal bond is a mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship between people and other animals that is influenced by behaviors. Pets effectively motivate people in many ways. Dogs are extraordinary at encouraging owners to go out and exercise, and this can be helpful for those who are suffering from mental illness. Also, they can relieve stress that are affecting their owners. The comfort of dog ownership expands to your intellectual health as well. Dog owners are less likely to be depressed and the people who are already diagnosed with the illness are likely to not be as depressed as others. Being attentive for a dog helps lessen indications of depression and inspire people to be more enthusiastic. I struggled with major depression before I got my dog. Everyday, I would wake up anxious and force myself to go to school. I tried everything; therapy, anti-depressants, and even yoga but it did not do much for me. A few years later, my family and I decided to adopt a dog and let me tell you, that changed my life. Sure, it did not get rid of my depression but although it did lessen it and make it more bearable. Every morning, I could not wait to see my dog the second I woke up which helped me go to school a little bit easier. Listening to what people say about the benefits of pets now, I know it is true. Bringing a pet into my life brought joy and I feel like when my mental illness tries to bring me down, I can just look at my dog and everything will be alright.",

      "Doug and Shawn Holiday are the owners of Biggs BBQ and Burger’s by Biggs in beautiful Lawrence, Kansas. They started Biggs BBQ in 2004 and have had many successes throughout their years. Biggs has been voted “Best BBQ in Lawrence” for 9+ years and is the longest operating BBQ restaurant in Lawrence. I had the wonderful opportunity to sit down with both Doug and Shawn. I received two different perspectives from these two, both having different roles and focuses in the business but share the same end goal. In this interview I had the pleasure to talk to them about how they accomplish their success, manage to continue to improve their business, and go above and beyond to meet 110% guest satisfaction. Shawn puts a lot of emphasis on making sure her and Doug’s employees are properly trained and know how to treat the guest to the best of their ability. I asked Shawn how she selects the people that work for them and her response was that they “base it on personality and attitude” and whether the potential employee is “excited about working.” Shawn also added that they aren’t worried about whether an applicant has experience because they strongly believe in their own training program.",
